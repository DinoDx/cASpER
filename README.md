  2. the .zip file of the plug-in, downloadable from GitHub from the following link: https://github.com/simgam/cASpER/tree/master/Code/build/distributions/casper-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip

Once the preparations are complete, open the Settings console (via the "File" menu or Ctlr + Alt + s shortcut) and select the "Plugins" sub-item.

Select, as shown in Figure figure: Settings Screen, the "Install Plugin from Disk" item and search for the .zip file of the plug-in. Click OK to apply the changes and restart the IDE, if required, to complete the ASCETIC installation.
